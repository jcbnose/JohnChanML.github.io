## Welcome to my Machine Learning Page
My first blog topic is about teaching machine how to read table.

### Table Understanding
Table Undestanding can be a complex machine learning problem.  Unlike Natural Language Processing (NLP) which crawls over unstructured text and extract information out of a sentance or a paragraph, or even an article, Table Understanding is about extracting the context of information arranged in a variety of structural representations, often arranged in rows and columns.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jcbnose/JohnChanML.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
