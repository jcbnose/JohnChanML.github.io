## Welcome to my Machine Learning Page
My first blog topic is about teaching machine how to read a table in a document.

### Table Understanding or TUML
Table Undestanding can be a complex machine learning problem.  Unlike Natural Language Processing (NLP) which crawls over unstructured text and extracts information out of a sentance, a paragraph, or even an article, Table Understanding is about extracting information arranged in a variety of structural representations, often arranged in **rows and columns**.

### Let's define the problem:
**Basic**
- Table Structure Recongition (TSR): turn a table from a scanned document (or programetic document) into cell documents that no structural and content information are loss.
- Table Attribute Extraction (TAE): ability to retrieve table cell content 

**Advanced**
- TSR to include embedded content which is not text, e.g. embedded chart or picture in a table
- Recognize tables span across multiple pages of a document

**Very Advanced**
- Reason over table content:
  including table meta data, references from and to its document
